Assignment Task: Basic Webpage Creation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to create a simple webpage using HTML and CSS.

Task Description: You are required to create a webpage with the following specifications:

The webpage should consist of a header, main content area with 7 sections, and a footer.

The header should contain a heading (e.g., "Welcome to My Website").

The main content area should have 7 sections, each with a heading (e.g., "Section 1," "Section 2," etc.) and some text content (you can use lorem ipsum text or write your own content).

Apply basic styling using CSS to format the sections. Use different background colors, margins, padding, and borders to make each section visually distinct.

The footer should contain a copyright notice (e.g., "Â© 2024 Your Name").

Submission Guidelines:

Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and a CSS file (e.g., styles.css) for your webpage.
Structure your HTML code using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
Apply CSS styles to format and style your webpage elements.
Ensure your webpage is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
Note: This assignment is designed to help you practice basic HTML and CSS concepts. Focus on creating and styling the main content sections and footer without including a navigation bar.
