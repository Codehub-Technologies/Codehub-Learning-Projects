# Time Countdown in JavaScript

### Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a time countdown using JavaScript that starts from a specified time (e.g., 20 minutes) and updates dynamically until it reaches zero while showing a background loader. This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and interval timers.

### Requirement/Task Description
- Create an HTML file with a display area to show the countdown timer 
- Use JavaScript to implement a function that starts the countdown timer
- Set the initial countdown time to `20 seconds` (or any desired time) and display it in the countdown timer area.
- Implement a countdown mechanism that updates the displayed time every second until it reaches zero.
- Include comments in your JavaScript code to explain the purpose of each section and enhance code readability.
