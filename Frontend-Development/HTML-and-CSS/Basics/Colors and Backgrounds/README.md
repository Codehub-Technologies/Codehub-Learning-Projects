### Exercise 1: Custom Gradient Background Card
**Objective**: Practice using different gradient types for creating visually appealing backgrounds.

**Instructions**:
1. Create a simple card with a title, a short paragraph, and a button.
2. Set the background of the card to a **linear gradient** of your choice (e.g., transitioning from light blue to dark blue).
3. Use a **radial gradient** as the background for the button.
4. Try applying a **repeating-linear gradient** to add a decorative border around the card.
5. Style the text with a color that complements your gradients.

**Bonus**: Experiment with a **conic gradient** as the card's background, and use transparency in your colors to see the difference it makes.

### Exercise 2: Image and Color Blend Modes
**Objective**: Explore CSS blend modes to create overlay effects with images and colors.

**Instructions**:
1. Create a `div` with a background image of your choice.
2. Add a `background-color` overlay using RGBA to make the image semi-transparent.
3. Apply different `background-blend-mode` properties like `multiply`, `screen`, and `overlay` to see how each blend mode affects the appearance of the image with the color overlay.
4. Experiment with a **CSS filter** (e.g., blur, grayscale) on the background image to enhance the overall effect.

**Bonus**: Use **CSS filters** on a separate text element inside the div, applying effects like `brightness` or `saturation` to see how they interact with the background image.

### Exercise 3: Animated Gradient Background
**Objective**: Use CSS gradients and keyframes to create an animated background.

**Instructions**:
1. Set up a full-width, full-height container `div`.
2. Apply a **linear gradient** as the background with at least two colors.
3. Create a CSS animation using `@keyframes` to animate the gradient colors (e.g., shifting the gradient from left to right).
4. Apply the animation to your background to create a moving color effect.

**Bonus**: Try animating a **radial gradient** and adjust the color stops dynamically to create a pulsing effect.
