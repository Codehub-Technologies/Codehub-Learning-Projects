# Task 1: Interactive Navigation Menu with Hover and Active States

Objective: Use pseudo-classes to create an interactive navigation menu with hover and active effects.

### Instructions:

* Create a simple navigation bar with links (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
* Style the links to change their background color on hover using the :hover pseudo-class.
* Use the :active pseudo-class to change the text color of a link when it is clicked.
* Add a :focus style to highlight a link if it’s accessed via keyboard (e.g., add an outline or change the color).
* Include a :visited state to indicate links that have already been clicked (if linking to different sections or pages).

Bonus: Use ::before or ::after to add an underline effect or small icon next to each link when it’s hovered.

# Task 2: Stylish Article Card with First Line and First Letter Effects
Objective: Use pseudo-elements to add creative styling to an article card.

### Instructions:

* Create a container with a title, a short paragraph, and a “Read More” link to represent a blog post or article card.
* Use the ::first-line pseudo-element to make the first line of the paragraph bold and a slightly different color.
* Use the ::first-letter pseudo-element to style the first letter of the paragraph (e.g., make it larger, add a color, and make it bold).
* Add a hover effect using :hover on the "Read More" link to change its color or underline it.

Bonus: Add a ::before pseudo-element to display a small decorative line or shape above the title of the article.
