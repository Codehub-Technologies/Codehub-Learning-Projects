# Day and Night Toggle Task

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a Day and Night toggle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
When the toggle switch is clicked, it should switch between day and night modes, adjusting the background 
color and visual elements accordingly. This project aims to reinforce understanding of front-end web 
development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling for dynamic effects.

## Task Description
- Create an HTML file (`index.html`) with a toggle switch for day and night modes.
- Implement CSS (`styles.css`) to style the toggle switch and adjust background colors for day and night modes.
- Use JavaScript (`script.js`) to handle the toggle functionality and update the UI based on the selected mode.
- Adjust text color and other visual elements to enhance readability in both day and night modes.
- Ensure a smooth transition between day and night modes for a visually appealing user experience.
