# Random Color Generator
### Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a random color generator using JavaScript that generates and displays random colors when triggered. This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript functions for generating random values.

### Requirement/Task Description

- Create an HTML file with a button labeled `Change Color` and a display area to show the randomly generated color.
- Use JavaScript to implement a function that generates a random color code when the `Change Color` button is clicked.
- Update the display area to show the randomly generated color code and apply the color to the background or text of the display area.
- Ensure that each time the button is clicked, a new random color is generated and displayed.
- Add CSS styling to enhance the visual appearance of the button and the display area.
- Include comments in your JavaScript code to explain the purpose of each section and enhance code readability.
