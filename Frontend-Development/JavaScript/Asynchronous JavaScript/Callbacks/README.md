# Callbacks Tasks

## Objectives
In this task, you will explore the concept of callback functions in JavaScript. You will create a simple application that demonstrates the use of callbacks in various scenarios, such as handling asynchronous operations, event handling, and function composition.

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a folder named `JavaScriptCallbacks` for your project.
- Create a `README.md` file in your project folder with a brief description of the project
- Submit the zipped folder containing your project on the designated platform or to your instructor for evaluation.

## Tasks
### Task One: Asynchronous Operations with Callbacks
- Create a JavaScript file (`async_callbacks.js`) in the src directory.
- Write a function `simulateAsyncTask(callback)` that simulates an asynchronous task (e.g., fetching data from an API) using `setTimeout`.
- Implement a callback function that processes the result of the asynchronous task.

### Task Two: Event Handling with Callbacks
- Create an HTML file (`index.html`) in the public directory.
- Add a button and a section element to the HTML file.
- Write JavaScript code (`event_callbacks.js`) to handle a button click event.
- Use a callback function to update the content of the div element when the button is clicked.

### Task Three: Function Composition with Callbacks
- Create another JavaScript file (`function_composition.js`) in the src directory.
- Define multiple functions that perform different operations (e.g., add, subtract, multiply).
- Write a higher-order function that takes callback functions as arguments and composes them to perform a complex operation.

### Task Four: Integration and Testing
- Link the JavaScript files (`async_callbacks.js`, `event_callbacks.js`, `function_composition.js`) to the HTML file (`index.html`).
- Test each functionality separately to ensure callback functions are working as expected.
- Use browser developer tools/console for debugging and logging.
