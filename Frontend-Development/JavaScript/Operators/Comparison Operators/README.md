# Comparison Operators

1. Loose Equality with Mixed Types
- Declare two variables: `x` as the number `10`, and `y` as the string `"10"`.
- Check if they are equal using the `loose equality operator`.

2. Strict Equality with Strings and Numbers
- Declare `a` as the number `5` and `b` as the string `"5"`.
- Check if they are `strictly equal`.

3. Null vs Undefined Comparison
- Declare `value1` as `null` and `value2` as `undefined`.
- Compare them using `loose equality`.

4. Boolean vs Numeric Equality
- Declare `isActive` as the boolean `true` and `statusCode` as the number `1`.
- Check if they are `strictly equal`.

5. String Alphabetical Order
- Declare `fruit1` as `"mango"` and `fruit2` as `"apple"`.
- Check if `fruit1` is `greater than` `fruit2`.

6. Object Reference Check
- Declare two objects `obj1` and `obj2`, both with property `id: 1`.
- Check if they are `strictly equal`.

7. Array vs String Coercion
- Declare `list` as the array `[1, 2, 3]` and text as the string `"1,2,3"`.
- Check if they are `loosely equal`.

8. NaN Equality Test
- Declare `result1` and `result2` both as `NaN`.
- Check if they are `strictly equal`.

9. Mixed-Type Greater-Than Check
- Declare `price` as the string `"20"` and `discount` as the number `15`.
- Check if `price` is `greater than or equal` to discount.

10. Not Equal Operator
- Declare `age` as the string "25" and `years` as the number 25.
- Check if they are `not equal` using `!=`.
