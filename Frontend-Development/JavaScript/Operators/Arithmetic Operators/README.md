# Arithmetic Operators

### Basic Operations:
- Declare two variables, x with the value 10 and y with the value 5.
- Calculate and display the sum, difference, product, division and quotient of x and y.
- Calculate and display the remainder of x divided by y using the modulus operator.


### Modulus Practice:
- Check if a number (e.g., 17) is even or odd using the modulus operator. Display "even" or "odd" accordingly.
- Find the remainder when 100 is divided by 7.
