# Variables Tasks
**Instruction:**
1. Create a file `variable.js` and complete the task below
2. Add relevant `comments` and organise your codes properly


### Declare Variables:

- Create a `const` variable `PI` with value `3.14159`

- Create a `let` variable `userAge` with your age

- Create a `var` variable `favoriteFood` with your favorite food

### Reassign Values:

- Update `userAge` to `userAge + 5`

- Try to update `PI` to `3.14` (what happens?)


### Calculate your Age
- Store your birth year in a variable.
- Store a future year in a variable.
- Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values. For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
- Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.


### Temperature Converter
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."

### Properties of a Circle
calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.
- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
