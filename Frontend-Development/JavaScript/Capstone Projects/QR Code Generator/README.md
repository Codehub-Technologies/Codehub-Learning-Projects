### Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a dynamic color slider using JavaScript that updates the background color value dynamically based on user input. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling using JavaScript.

### Requirement/Task Description
- Create an HTML file with a simple layout that includes a color slider element and a display area to show the selected color.
- Use JavaScript to implement a color slider functionality that allows users to adjust the color dynamically.
- When the user interacts with the color slider (e.g., drags the slider), update the display area to show the selected color in real-time.
- Add CSS styling to enhance the visual appearance of the color slider and the display area.
- Ensure that the color displayed in the display area corresponds to the position of the slider on the color spectrum.
- Include comments in your JavaScript code to explain the purpose of each section and enhance code readability.
