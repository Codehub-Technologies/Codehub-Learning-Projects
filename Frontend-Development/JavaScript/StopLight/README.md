# Traffic light Simulation Task in JavaScript
### Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a web-based simulation of a traffic light using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic interactivity in web development.

### Requirement/Task Description
- Create an HTML file named index.html that includes the following elements:
  - Three buttons labeled `Stop`, `Slow`, and `Go` to simulate the traffic light signals.
- A container `section` to display the current state of the traffic light.
- Style the traffic light container and buttons using CSS to resemble a typical traffic light setup (red, yellow, and green lights).
- Use JavaScript to implement functionality that toggles the visibility of each light (green, red, yellow) when its corresponding button is clicked.
- Ensure that clicking a button turns on the respective light (e.g., clicking `Go button`  displays the `green light`, `stop` button red, `slow` button yellow and clicking again hides it).
- Add comments to your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain the purpose of each section and enhance code readability.
- Test your traffic light simulation by clicking each button to see the corresponding light display and disappear.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Create a folder for your exercise project and name it appropriately (e.g., TrafficLightSimulation).
- Include the `index.html` file for your UI layout, `styles.css` file for styling, and `script.js` file for JavaScript functionality in your project folder.
- Implement the traffic light simulation functionality using JavaScript in the `script.js` file.
- Style the traffic light container and buttons using CSS in the styles.css file to resemble a real traffic light setup.
- Test your traffic light simulation by clicking each button to ensure that the lights toggle visibility correctly.
- Ensure that the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Create a `README.md` file in your project folder and provide a brief description of your traffic light simulation project, including how to interact with the traffic light buttons.
- Submit your exercise project on the designated platform or to your instructor for evaluation.
