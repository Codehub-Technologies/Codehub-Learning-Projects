**Instruction:**
1. Create a file `python_oop_task_one.py` and complete the task below
2. Add relevant `comments` and organise your codes properly

**Task**
1. Create a `class` named Triangle.
2. Create an `object` from it. The object will have three attributes that represent the sides of the triangle.
3. The Triangle class will have two methods:
    * The `__init__()` method to initialize the sides.
    * A method to calculate the `perimeter` of the triangle from its sides.
    * The `perimeter` of the triangle should be printed from outside the class.
