# If, Elif, Else Exercises

### Exercise One
Write an `if statement` that asks for the user's name via `input()` function. If the name is "Bond" make it print "Welcome on board 007." Otherwise make it print "Good morning NAME". (Replace Name with user's name)

### Exercise Two
Do the same thing as `Exercise One` this time making sure if the name is bond with lower case b it still prints "Welcome on board 007."

### Exercise Three
Write a function named "evens" which returns `True` if a number is even and otherwise returns `False`.
